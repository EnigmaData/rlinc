rlinc
=====

It is the python package for anyone that is starting in the field of
Reinforcement Learning. This focuses on providing implementation for
some of the most common Bandits and other RL problems.

One can also extend these classes and use these implementations for
other use cases like website SEO and other stuff.

this package currently has two modules:
* selection
* testing

selection
---------

This modules has all the algorithms related to the multiarm bandit problems
ranging from absolute greedy to state of the art UCB algorithm.

testing
-------

It is the module concerning with testing the multiarm Bandits. You can
modify these to model you problem in a better manner and selecct which
algorithm is performing good for your problem.
